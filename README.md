# Uninformed Search
The main uninformed search algorithms are implemented and discussed in detail. 

This includes Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search, Backtracking Search, Depth-Limited Search, Iterative-Deepening Search, Uniform-Cost Search, and Bi-directional Search.

<h2>What is uninformed search?</h2>

Given a start node in a graph, an uninformed search will look for a goal node. However, he algorithm is not allowed/capable of determining/predicting how close to the goal it is. The efforts made by the algorithm are not directed by a score, or any similar concept. 

An example of this would be placing a person in a country they know nothing about, and asking them to find a specific city without asking for directions or any other geological information.
